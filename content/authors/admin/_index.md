I am a health psychologist and postdoctoral researcher at the Health, Medical and Neuropsychology unit of Leiden University and a member of the Center for Interdisciplinary Placebo Studies Leiden. My research interests lie in exploring the ways in which our expectations and previous experiences can impact our health. I am a strong advocate for open science and work as the project manager for the Replications and Reversals project at Framework for Open and Reproducible Research Training. In addiiton to my scientific work, I serve s a part-time grant writer for the non-profit organization Health&Help, which provides essential medical care to underserved communities in Central America. I am passionate about using my skills and knowledge to advance science and make a positive impact in the world.
