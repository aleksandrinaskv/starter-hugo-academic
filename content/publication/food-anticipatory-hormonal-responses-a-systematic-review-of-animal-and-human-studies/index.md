abstract: Food anticipatory hormonal responses (cephalic responses) are
  proactive physiological processes, that allow animals to prepare for food
  ingestion by modulating their hormonal levels in response to food cues. This
  process is important for digesting food, metabolizing nutrients and
  maintaining glucose levels within homeostasis. In this systematic review, we
  summarize the evidence from animal and human research on cephalic responses.
  Thirty-six animal and fifty-three human studies were included. The majority
  (88 %) of studies demonstrated that hormonal levels are changed in response to
  cues previously associated with food intake, such as feeding time, smell, and
  sight of food. Most evidence comes from studies on insulin, ghrelin,
  pancreatic polypeptide, glucagon, and c-peptide. Moreover, impaired cephalic
  responses were found in disorders related to metabolism and food intake such
  as diabetes, pancreatic insufficiency, obesity, and eating disorders, which
  opens discussions about the etiological mechanisms of these disorders as well
  as on potential therapeutic opportunities.
