abstract: In contrast to classical conditioning of physiological responses such
  as immune responses and drug effects, only a limited number of studies
  investigated classical conditioning of endocrine responses. The present paper
  is the first systematic review that integrates evidence from animal and human
  trials regarding the possibility to condition the endocrine responses.
  Twenty-six animal and eight human studies were included in the review. We
  demonstrated that there is accumulating evidence that classical conditioning
  processes are able to influence specific endocrine responses, such as
  cortocosterone/cortisol and insulin, while more limited evidence exists for
  other hormones. Animal and human studies were generally consistent in their
  findings; however, the limited number of human studies makes it difficult to
  generalize and translate the results of animal research to humans. Next to
  methodological recommendations for future studies, we suggest several ways how
  classically conditioned endocrine responses can be used in clinical practice.
