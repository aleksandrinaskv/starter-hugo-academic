abstract: "Oxytocin has been shown to increase trust, decrease anxiety, and
  affect learning as has been observed in conditioning paradigms. Trust,
  anxiety, and learning are important factors that influence placebo effects. In
  this study, we investigated whether oxytocin can increase placebo analgesia,
  decrease nocebo hyperalgesia, and influence extinction processes of both.
  Eighty male volunteers were assigned to a 40 IU of oxytocin nasal spray group,
  or to a placebo control group. Placebo analgesia and nocebo hyperalgesia were
  induced by a conditioning procedure in combination with verbal suggestions.
  The results demonstrate that the conditioning procedure successfully elicited
  significant placebo analgesia and nocebo hyperalgesia responses (P < .001).
  Furthermore, extinction was observed (P < .001), although placebo and nocebo
  responses did not return to baseline and remained significant. Oxytocin did
  not influence placebo analgesia or nocebo hyperalgesia and had no effect on
  extinction. This study provides support against the placebo-boosting effects
  of oxytocin and was the first one to demonstrate that it also did not
  influence nocebo effects or extinction processes, however, these results
  pertain to only a male sample. As managing placebo and nocebo effects has
  widespread clinical implications, further research should investigate other
  neurobiological or behavioral pathways to boost placebo and decrease nocebo
  effects. PERSPECTIVE: The present study demonstrated that placebo analgesia
  and nocebo hyperalgesia can be successfully induced by conditioning and verbal
  suggestions. We could not confirm the hypothesis that oxytocin affects either
  of these phenomena. Other pharmacological agents and behavioral manipulations
  for increasing placebo and decreasing nocebo effects should be investigated."
