abstract: Contagious itch can be evoked by observing people scratching. Verbal
  suggestions about to-be-received itch can influence itch intensity, as shown
  by placebo research, but it is unknown whether this extends to contagious
  itch. The current study aimed to replicate prior findings that listening to
  scratching and rubbing sounds elicits contagious itch, and to investigate
  whether suggestions can modulate this process. Healthy participants (n = 140)
  received positive or negative suggestions about itch in response to the sounds
  (aimed to decrease or increase expected itch, respectively), or no specific
  suggestions as a control. Participants listened to a number of audio fragments
  with scratching and rubbing sounds. The amount of expected itch as well as
  itch sensation after each audio fragment were measured by self-report.
  Suggestions had no effect on the expected itch. Both rubbing and scratching
  sounds significantly elicited itch in all groups. Scratching sounds induced
  more itch than rubbing sounds exclusively in the control group. These findings
  indicate that short suggestions might be not effective enough to modify the
  expectations of people regarding contagious itch. Furthermore, suggestions
  modulate contagious itch to some degree, but not in the hypothesized
  direction. Potential similarities and differences in the neurobiological
  mechanisms of contagious itch and nocebo effects are discussed.
