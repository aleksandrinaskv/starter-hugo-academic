abstract: In an attempt to improve reproducibility, more attention is being paid
  to potential sources of stress in the laboratory environment. Here, we report
  that the mere proximity of pregnant or lactating female mice causes
  olfactory-mediated stress-induced analgesia, to a variety of noxious stimuli,
  in gonadally intact male mice. We show that exposure to volatile compounds
  released in the urine of pregnant and lactating female mice can themselves
  produce stress and associated pain inhibition. This phenomenon, a novel form
  of female-to-male chemosignaling, is mediated by female scent marking of
  urinary volatiles, such as n-pentyl-acetate, and likely signals potential
  maternal aggression aimed at defending against infanticide by stranger males.
