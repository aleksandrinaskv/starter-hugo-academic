abstract: "It has been demonstrated that secretion of several hormones can be
  classically conditioned, however, the underlying brain responses of such
  conditioning have never been investigated before. In this study we aimed to
  investigate how oxytocin administration and classically conditioned oxytocin
  influence brain responses. In total, 88 females were allocated to one of three
  groups: oxytocin administration, conditioned oxytocin, or placebo, and
  underwent an experiment consisting of three acquisition and three evocation
  days. Participants in the conditioned group received 24 IU of oxytocin
  together with a conditioned stimulus (CS) during three acquisition days and
  placebo with the CS on three evocation days. The oxytocin administration group
  received 24 IU of oxytocin and the placebo group received placebo during all
  days. On the last evocation day, fMRI scanning was performed for all
  participants during three tasks previously shown to be affected by oxytocin:
  presentation of emotional faces, crying baby sounds and heat pain. Region of
  interest analysis revealed that there was significantly lower activation in
  the right amygdala and in two clusters in the left superior temporal gyrus in
  the oxytocin administration group compared to the placebo group in response to
  observing fearful faces. The activation in the conditioned oxytocin group was
  in between the other two groups for these clusters but did not significantly
  differ from either group. No group differences were found in the other tasks.
  Preliminary evidence was found for brain activation of a conditioned oxytocin
  response; however, despite this trend in the expected direction, the
  conditioned group did not significantly differ from other groups. Future
  research should, therefore, investigate the optimal timing of conditioned
  endocrine responses and study whether the findings generalize to other
  hormones as well."
