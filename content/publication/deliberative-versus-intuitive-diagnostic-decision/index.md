abstract: Several studies have demonstrated that in the mental health domain,
  experience does not always lead to better diagnostic decisions, suggesting
  that in clinical psychology experience-based intuition might actually not
  improve performance. The aim of the current study was to investigate
  differences in preferred reasoning styles of novice and experienced clinical
  psychologists as possible explanation of this surprising phenomenon. We
  investigated clinical and control decisions of novice (n = 20) and experienced
  (n = 20) clinical psychologists as well as age-matched controls (n = 20 and n
  = 20 respectively) by using vignettes and MouselabWeb matrices. We assessed
  their reasoning style preferences by using the Rational-Experiential Inventory
  (Pacini & Epstein, 1999). Results showed that experienced and novice clinical
  psychologists did not differ in diagnostic accuracy and that experienced
  psychologists had a higher preference for rational thinking than novices. We
  also found that in experienced psychologists a stronger preference for
  deliberation was associated with greater accuracy, and in novice psychologists
  a stronger preference for intuitive reasoning was associated with less
  accurate decisions. It might be that it is not a question of more experience
  but of deliberation about the task that could help clinicians perform more
  accurately.
