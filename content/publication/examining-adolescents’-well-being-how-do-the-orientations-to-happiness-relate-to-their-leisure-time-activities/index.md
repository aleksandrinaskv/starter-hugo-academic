abstract: Three ways of achieving happiness—life of pleasure, life of
  engagement, and life of meaning (Seligman, 2002)—have been examined among
  adult samples. However, very few studies have investigated these orientations
  to happiness in non-adult populations. Numerous studies have found that
  different ways of spending leisure time affect the psychological well-being of
  adolescents. Bringing these two perspectives together, the aim of the present
  study is to identify the extent to which orientations to happiness are related
  to well-being and choice of leisure time activities in a sample of adolescents
  from eight European countries.
