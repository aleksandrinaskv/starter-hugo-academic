Breaking bad news is a crucial aspect of healthcare communication, demanding empathy and sensitivity. To equip healthcare providers with the necessary skills, we're developing a communication training program funded by Erasmus Plus. This virtual reality (VR) training will simulate realistic scenarios where trainees interact with virtual patients, allowing them to practice delivering bad news in a controlled environment. Our consortium, including partners such as 3dsense s.r.o., Univerzita Karlova, Universiteit Leiden, University College Cork, Hanover Medical School, National University of Ireland, Cork, Universidade Catolica Portuguesa, and Ludwig Maximilian University Munich, aims to enhance healthcare education and patient care through this innovative approach.
