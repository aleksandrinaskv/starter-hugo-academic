 My main scientific interest is understanding mind-body interaction, and placebo effect is the perfect example of it. My research focuses on understanding how the placebo effect can impact physiological markers of health, specifically in the neuroendocrine system. 

To study the placebo effect in the endocrine system, we utilize a pharmacological conditioning experimental design with both learning and testing phases. In the learning phase, we combine an active medication that affects hormonal levels with a conditioned stimulus, such as a specific scent. In the testing phase, we present participants with the scent alone and measure their physiological response to it.

I have conducted two large randomized controlled trials investigating whether it is possible to condition oxytocin responses in healthy volunteers, and insulin responses in both healthy volunteers and individuals with type-2 diabetes. The results of these studies have been published in 2019 and 2022.

Moving forward, my research will continue to focus on investigating how pharmacological conditioning can be utilized to enhance the effectiveness of standard medications in clinical settings.

I am open to collaborations on this topic!
