My research seeks to uncover the physiological and neural mechanisms underlying placebo and nocebo effects. By examining the changes that occur in our bodies when we experience symptom relief or exacerbation due to expectancy, I hope to shed light on this fascinating area of study. Furthermore, understanding these mechanisms is crucial in clinical practice, where the ability to harness placebo effects and avoid nocebo effects can greatly improve patient outcomes.

To achieve these goals, I investigate several potential hormonal modulators of placebo and nocebo effects, including oxytocin, cholecystokinin, and cortisol. I use a range of research methods, including human and animal models as well as neuroimaging techniques, to explore these mechanisms and gain a more complete understanding of their impact on human health.
