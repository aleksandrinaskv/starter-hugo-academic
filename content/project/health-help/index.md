Health & Help is a non-commercial organization that delivers basic medical care in the areas with limited resources in Latin America. At the moment, it runs two clinics in extremely remote rural areas of Guatemala and Nicaragua where no other medical help is available. It is an inspiring organization primarily run by volunteers, whose compassion and enthusiasm make a huge difference in the world.

I am using the skills and knowledge from academia to build a grant writing department, as grants can be a sustainable and stable way to guarantee funds for such small organization.

If you share our belief that no one should die from treatable diseases, please consider donating to [support](https://he-he.org/#block-8) our work.
